For this assignment you are to use read in this text for your input (input.txt) for input to your scala and java program.  In this project you are to read each word in from the assignment file and output the list of unique words and the number of times each word comes up within the assignment file. For both programs you are to create two types of classes: one class that manages all the word objects, and another class whose instance takes in a unique word through its constructor function. This word encapsulating class must contain a member function update that increments its word count every time this word is found within the text. Points will be given based on producing the correct output, creating the manager and container class and lastly for style. This assignment is worth 20 pts.
